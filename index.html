            <!-- this is my favourite song i write here      -->
              
                    I found a love for me<br>
                    Darling just dive right in<br>
                    And follow my lead<br>
                    Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet<br>
                    I never knew you were the someone waiting for me<br>
                    'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love<br>
                    Not knowing what it was<br>
                    I will not give you up this time<br>
                    But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own<br>
                    And in your eyes you're holding mine<br>
                    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms<br>
                    Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>
                    When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath<br>
                    But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
                    Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know<br>
                    She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home<br>
                    I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets<br>
                    To carry love, to carry children of our own<br>
                    We are still kids, but we're so in love<br>
                    Fighting against all odds<br>
                    I know we'll be alright this time<br>
                    Darling, just hold my hand<br>
                    Be my girl, I'll be your man<br>
                    I see my future in your eyes<br>
                    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
                    Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>
                    When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful<br>
                    I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight<br>
                    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms<br>
                    Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song<br>
                    I have faith in what I see<br>
                    Now I know I have met an angel in person<br>
                    And she looks perfect<br>
                    I don't deserve this<br>
                    You look perfect tonight
                </p>
